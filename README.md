# R_shiny_app_demo

I have choosen to analyze the data from [Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304269) by O'Mera et al. by utilizing R shiny to create an approachable way to explore the data generated through the numerous experimental conditions explored in this paper. 
My app allows users to explore the type of data available. See the video below for a quick overview of the app!
