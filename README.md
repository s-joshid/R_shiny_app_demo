# Background 
I have chosen to analyze the data from [Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate During Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration](https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304269) by O'Mera et al. This paper was interesting as they explore the gene expression of adult mice, neonatal mice, and mice cardiac cell lines to undercover the gene expression differences that may determine why mice loose the ability to regenerate their cardiac cells over time. The authors were also committed to open source science and had great data availability. 

# Approach
I utilized R shiny to create an approachable way to explore the data generated through the numerous experimental conditions explored in this paper. 
My app allows users to explore the type of data available, the gene expression differences, the pathway differences between experimental groups and more. This information is presented in multiple formats such as tables, heatmaps, PCA plots, volcano plots, and more. See the video below for a quick overview of the app !
